# Langue

Look, there is a binary alright but it might need the file.mad next to it <br />
I'll be working on version 1.1.0 ASAP to widen its use case

# How to use
alright, so all you can do is just set an integer variable and retrieve it

1. Download the binary -> langue<br />
2. Write a file with a file extension ".mad" (not really necessary, even .cpp, .py and .js files are accepted XD)
3. run ./langue <path/to/file> in the terminal and enjoy

# How to write valid code
okay, so each instruction needs a different line number

to set a variable: set <variable_name> <value> <br />
to retrieve the value of that variable: get <variable_name>

easy!
